Movie Recommendation

Arighna Roy

### I.  Definition

## Project Overview

- A  recommendation  engine  can  be  used  for  a  lot  of  applications  such  as  categorization  of

- products  and  responding  to  users'  individual  interest.  In  this  project,  I  have  tried  to

- recommend products (movies) to users (viewers) based on the viewer to movie rating data.

- The underlying technique to achieve the goal is collaborative filtering. I have used both user

- based and content based collaborative filtering and made a comparative study.

- There are multiple techniques to build a recommendation engine such as item set mining,

- collaborative filtering, content based filtering and knowledge based filtering. Item set mining

- is used in filtering out the items which are frequently used together. Collaborative filtering

- can be used when users' ratings for different products are available. For Content based and

- knowledge based filtering, we need information related to products or some prior knowledge

- about the market.

## Problem Statement

- I have a set of users for which the ratings to different movies are available. Now, for a new

- user with his ratings for few of the existing (rated by existing users) movies is taken as an

- input. I aim to predict the rating of that user to a movie which he has not rated, but that movie

- is rated by other users. Let me explain the problem with an example. Suppose, there are 3

- users a,b,c. a rated movie 1,2,3; b rated movie 2,3,4; c rated 3,4,5. Now a new user d rated

- movie 1,4,5; I aim to predict the rating of movie 2,3 for user d.

- Step1: preprocess the user rating file. We removed the outliers from the rating dataset. Users

- who rated too low or too high number of movies are considered as outliers. Similarly, movies

- rated by too low or too high number of users are considered as outliers.

- step2: generate a python dictionary for the user to movie ratings. Each key of the dictionary

- is a user id(suppose u). Values of each key(u) is another dictionary. The key of each dictionary

- is a movie id (suppose m) and the corresponding value is the rating of that movie(m) by the

- user (u).

- step3: build a similarity matrix between users. Each key of the dictionary is a user id(suppose

- u1). Values of each key(u1) is another dictionary. The key of each dictionary is another user

- id (suppose u2) and the corresponding value is the similarity between the two users (u1 and

- u2).

- step4:  build  a  similarity  matrix  between  movies.  Each  key  of  the  dictionary  is  a  movie

- id(suppose m1). Values of each key(m1) is another dictionary. The key of each dictionary is

- another movie id (suppose m2) and the corresponding value is the similarity between the two

- movies (m1 and m2).

- step5: loop through each user-movie pair and find the predicted rating of the movie for that

- user using both user based and movie based collaborative filtering.

- step6: Compare the predicted value and actual rating. Calculate the MSE.

## Metrics

- I use the same user-movie pairs from the training set and compare it with the existing rating.

- Suppose, user A has rated x (<10) to movie 1. I predict the ratings of movie 1 for the user a

- using my method. The rating of movie 1 for user A is ignored. And the performance of the

- prediction is measured based on the comparison with the value x (actual rating).

- There are many performance metrics which can be considered to evaluate the correctness of

- the algorithm.

- Root  Mean  Squared  Error (RMSE),  Mean  Absolute  Error  (MAE),  Mean  Signed  Deviation

- (MSD) are the most widely used error metrics.

- I chose RMSE over MAE and MSD. MAE is the absolute deviation of the predicted value. RAE is

- good where I want the impact of deviation to be equal at every scale as opposed to in RMSE the

- effect of deviation exponentially increases. In my opinion, RMSE is more appropriate here because

- the scale is small here and the number of rating option is also small (5).  MSD is not applicable

- here because we donâ€™t need to know whether the predicted value is higher or lower than the actual

- value. We just want to find the absolute value.

- To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, I have used root-mean-square error as the

- performance metric.

- Algorithms and Techniques

- I have used the collaborative filtering (both user based and movie based) to find the nearest

- neighbors for predicting the rating. For each pair of user and movie in the testing dataset, I

- have omitted the rating and made a prediction based on the all other ratings. Then compared

- the prediction.

- Benchmark

- The winner of the Netflix competition for movie rating prediction achieved RMSE=0.86. They followed

- such  a  complicated  method  which  took  almost  3  years  to  complete.  For  a  simple  and  standard

- approach like this, I would keep a target of an RMSE<=1 which is practical. One point to note that the

- difference in RMSE might look very small but in a scale of 5, the difference in RMSE of 0.14 is actually

- pretty large.

### III.  Methodology

## Data Preprocessing

- Itâ€™s always a good idea to pre-process the data before starting the actual analysis or building

- the application. This dataset doesnâ€™t have any missing values or non-numeric values. I have

- done outlier detection and removal as part of pre-processing.

- 1% of the users rated less than 9 movies. 9 is a very small number in terms of movies rated.

- Itâ€™s very difficult to judge someoneâ€™s taste of movie based on the ratings of just 9 movies. So

- remove the users who rated less than 9 movies for my analysis. 5% of the users rated more

- than 507 movies. I consider them someone having variety of taste in the choice of movies.

- Those users should not be used for the analysis. The reason we choose 5% in the upper tail

- and 1% in the lower tail is because we have a right skewed distribution for the count of movies

- rated by each user.

- I want to consider the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution while finding the

- outliers in the upper tail of the distribution. 77 users rated number of movies which are 3

- standard  deviation  above  the  mean  of  the  distribution.  But  I  am  dealing  with  the  highly

- skewed distribution. I would rather prefer the quadrantile data than the variance. Also, I set

- these values after a careful consideration of the count of movies.

- Below is the histogram of the count of movies rated by the each user before (blue) and after

- (green) the removal of the outliers.

- Now, 5% of the movies have ratings from less than 3 users. I feel that movies having very low

- ratings cannot be removed because those could be movies of rare taste. Also movies with a

- lot  of  ratings  can  be  removed  because  those  are  the  most  watched  movies  which  are

- important to judge usersâ€™ taste of movies.

- Implementation

- The implementation of my project is broken down into few ipython notebooks.

- Visualization:

- In this notebook, I have performed the statistical analysis of the data and further exploratory

- analysis.

- I have used pandas and numpy to read the data and visualize the summary statistics of the

- data.

- Pre-processing:

- In this notebook I have detected the outliers and prepared the final data for analysis.

- Reco:

- In this notebook, I have implemented the prediction algorithm

- I have implemented user based prediction, movie based prediction and the average of the

- previous 2 values to test the accuracy of the result.

- Results:

- Here, I have generated the plots based the prediction of movie rating.

- I have used Collaborative filtering for predicting the rating of a movie by one user. This is also

- called the social filtering. Let me explain this idea with an example. Suppose, I hang out with

- some friends on regular basis. The group is quite diverse based on their tastes of food. Few

- of them have similar tastes as mine. I figured that out when we went to restaurants together

- and they liked or disliked the food along with me. Now, I want to go to a restaurant alone and

- want review of the restaurant. More than the online reviews, I would like to have the reviews

- from those friends who have similar tastes of food as mine. I can say that the rating I am going

- to give to a restaurant is likely to be close to the ratings those people have already given. This

- is  exactly  the  same  idea  behind  user  based  collaborative  filtering.  In  our  problem,  the

- restaurant is replaced by movie and my friends are the online users. I have used  user based

- and movie based collaborative filtering for finding out the rating of a movie by one user.

- Outline of the implementation of collaborative filtering

- Let me discuss the outline of implementation of prediction algorithm here.

- Predict rating by user based collaborative filtering:

- ï‚·  Build the similarity matrix for users

ïƒ˜  For a pair of users, find the movies which both the users have rated. Now findthe distance between the usersâ€™ ratings for the common movies. Use one ofthe distance metrics to calculate this.

ïƒ˜  Repeat this for each user pair of users

- ï‚·  Pick a combination of user and movie from the testing set

- ï‚·  Filter the users which have rated that movie

- ï‚·  Find the users with min distances from the chosen user

- ï‚·  Now find the average of the ratings given by those users to that movie

- Predict rating by movie based collaborative filtering:

- ï‚·  Build the similarity matrix for movies with a similar process followed for user similarity

matrix

- ï‚·  Pick a combination of user and movie from the testing set

- ï‚·  Filter the movies which rated by that user

- ï‚·  Find the movies with min distances from the chosen movie

- ï‚·  Now find the average of the ratings given by that user to those movies

- Refinement

- While approaching this problem, I though 2 methods to consider: collaborative filtering and

- content  based  filtering.  The  major  dataset  I  need  for  collaborative  filtering  is  the  ratings

- history and for content based filtering is the movie features. But the dataset I considered had

- only few features of each movie which were not sufficient to make a good prediction about

- the rating. So I chose collaborative filtering.

- Now, there are two different methods to consider in collaborative filtering, user based rating

- and movie based rating. I decided to perform both and do a comparison study.

- I first included all the data in training to predict the rating of each movie by each user. This

- wasnâ€™t such a bad idea because K-nearest neighbour is a lazy learner. But to make the result

- beyond any confusion, I split the data into training and testing dataset with a ratio as 4:1.

- Thereafter,  the  model  parameters  were  to  be  decided  which  again  were  chosen  after  a

- comparative study of those.

- Several methods have been implemented to improve the performance of the algorithm.

- ï‚·  The value of k:

I have used the nearest neighbour approach to predict the rating of a movie by a user.The number of nearest neighbours is to be optimized to get the best result. I havecollected  the  results  for  each  iteration  for  different  values  of  â€˜kâ€™  (number  ofneighbours).

- ï‚·  Distance metric:

Different distance metrics are applied to find the nearest neighbours.

ïƒ˜  Euclidean distance:

straight forward and easy to calculate.

The Euclidean distance between two vectors X and Y is calculated as,

This  is  the  most  widely  used  distance  metric.  Euclidean  distance  is  prettyïƒ˜  Normalized Euclidean Distance:

Itâ€™s always a good idea to normalize the rating for a user. For example, supposeone user tend to give a good rating to movies. So a rating of 6 out of 10 is very![Image63](images/Image63)

poor.  And  the  other  user  might  be  quite  reserved  when  it  comes  to  ratemovies. So 6 could be average for him. So itâ€™s always better to normalize theratings so that scale comes to equal.

ïƒ˜  Manhattan Distance:

This is another distance metric when the absolute magnitude of the distanceis desired.

The Manhattan distance between two vectors X and Y is calculated as,

ïƒ˜  Minkowski Distance:

This the generalized version of both Manhattan and Euclidean distance. I haveimplemented this distance with the degree of 3.

The Minkowski distance between two vectors X and Y is calculated as,

ïƒ˜  Pearson Correlation Distance:

This is the most useful distance metric when it comes to collaborative filtering.It takes care of the variance of the ratings for each user.

The Pearson correlation distance between two vectors X and Y is calculated as,- ï‚·

- I have implemented both the user based filtering and movies filtering to predict the rating

- and  checked  the  accuracy.  Also,  the  average  of  the  previous  2  ratings  are  tested  for

- accuracy.

![Image69](images/Image69)

![Image70](images/Image70)

- IV. Results

- I have evaluated the recommendation engine with different parameters which are explained

- in the refinement section. Now letâ€™s check the comparative results.

![Image73](images/Image73)

![Image74](images/Image74)

- The performance of the recommendation engine is very good overall. Let us dig more into the

- parameters.

- Number of nearest neighbours

- All  three  figures  show  a  sharp  decline  in  the  error  rate  from  k=1  to  k=3.  It  further  slowly

- decrease up till k=10 and then freezes. So we can conclude that k=10 is the optimal value of

- the number of nearest neighbours.

- Distance metrics

- The above 3 figure clearly shows that the engine performs best when the distance metric is

- either Manhattan or Euclidean. These show significant difference in performance when used

- for user based filtering or the average of used based and movie based.

- Pearson  Correlation  metric  performs  the  worst  as  a  distance  metric  which  surprises  me

- because this is one of the most widely used distance metric when it comes to collaborative

- filtering.

- Now letâ€™s check the speed of the engine for different parameters. The below 3 figures clearly

- shows that the engines runs fastest when used with Pearson correlation distance. Manhattan,

- Euclidean and Minkowski make it slow. From the performance of the algorithm, we can say

- that  there  is  trade-off  between  speed  and  performance  when  Manhattan,  Euclidean  or

- Pearson correlation are used. But the engine is fast enough; so we can choose Manhattan or

- Euclidean for better performance.

![Image77](images/Image77)

![Image81](images/Image81)

![Image80](images/Image80)

- Justification

- I had set the benchmark of RMSE for this algorithm as 1. The lowest RMSE I could achieve was

- 0.9819. Also, I discussed that a small difference in RMSE on the scale of 5 is actually pretty

- large. So I have achieved an RMSE 0.02 less than the target value which is quite good.

![Image82](images/Image82)

- V. Conclusion

- From the results section, we can see that both the speed and accuracy of the engine is quite

- good. The engine performances the best when used with Manhattan or Euclidean distance as

- the distance metric and with the number of nearest neighbours to be considered as 10. Also,

- we can see that itâ€™s wise to use the average of the ratings calculated from the movie based

- filtering and user based filtering.

- Reflection

- It was a fun project to work on. The objective of the project was pretty straight forward and

- widely used in many applications. That makes it even more interesting. There were challenges

- as well for this kind of problem. There is no feature and instance dataset which is the most

- standard form of data in machine learning. Also I just had the rating data which made the

- approaches limited to collaborative filtering.  But the size of the dataset is large enough to

- make the model quite general.

- Free-Form Visualization

- There is an interesting visualization I want to share. The users are not well connected when it

- comes to the common films they rate. I have built a network graph where the nodes are the

- users and the edges signify that there is at least one common film the connecting users have

- rated.

- Let me show two networks; first one for the first 1000 ratings which contains only 38 users.

- Second one contain 10000 ratings which contain 84 users.

- The above network clearly show that the users are sparsely connected. So while trying to find

- nearest neighbours, we donâ€™t have much competition. One way to deal with this could be

- calculating the rating based on an approach which is a combination of both user based and

- movie based collaborative filtering.

- Improvement

![Image85](images/Image85)

![Image86](images/Image86)

- I have used collaborative filtering to predict the rating of a movie by a user. There is another

- popular method used for the same purpose which is content based filtering. One of the major

- area of improvement for this engine is to implement the prediction based on content based

- filtering. Doing a comparative study between these two kinds of filtering for recommendation

- system would be a nice approach. The features for each movie for my dataset wasnâ€™t quite

- strong. It would be naÃ¯ve to apply content based filtering for this dataset. But with enough

- information collected for the movies, we can perform a content based filtering for the same

- user and movie pairs.

- Another improvement can be to implement the approach explained in the last section.
